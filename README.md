# Wi-Fi-Enabled-Intelligent-Vegetable-Chopper
Wi-Fi-Enabled Intelligent Vegetable Chopper (wIVC) is a modern kitchen device that can be used in restaurants in order to reduce the amount of time spent on chopping vegetables in the kitchen. With its intelligence, the wIVC is able to chop vegetables in accordance with the orders it receives.  
Note: At the moment, a basic prototype has been built that achieves the desired functionality.
The attached document entitled Copy_Report_Wi-Fi enabled Intelligent Vegetable Chopper explains the project more in detail.
